What trends exist within US-county-level demographic data?

Suffixes at the end of variable names:
A: numpy array
B: boolean
D: dictionary
L: list
S: string
T: tuple
Underscores indicate chaining: for instance, "fooT_T" is a tuple of tuples

2014-06-26: You know what? Probably delete election2008.py. This project isn't going to be about temporal shifts, but rather, about static snapshots of county demographics at the present time. Next, make a list of all of your data sources, and for each source, write a script to read in all of the relevant data from that source. Then, write a function to join all of those tables together.
